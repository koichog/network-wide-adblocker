# Network-Wide Adblocker

This project provides a network-wide adblocker that can be easily installed on your system.

Squid-based adblocker that uses two blacklists for fitlering requests + WEB interface(Nginx). 

The web dashboard consist of
- page that shows real-time entries in access.log (status of requests - accepted/rejected) - done via websocket
- Configurations tab - done via flask:
        ---> modifying the URL used for the main blocklist
        ---> editing/viewing in real time the custom blocklist
        ---> restarting squid
        ---> viewing/flushing the flask logs
        
 Squid is rebuild from source with the neccesary flags for ssl bumping, the cert and the key are self generated during the installation.
 Same key and cert are used in Nginx for Authentication.
 The script also installs iptables and allows traffic on port 80,8080,8081,3128 for the local network.
 
 This is a BETA project that requires further security implementations. 
 However, this is a great project for home networks as it works fine as long as the usage/hardware is OK.
 
 I have other services configured on my raspberry pi and still I am using it for running the adblocker with few devices connected to it.
